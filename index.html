<div class="description">
  <p>In this fast-developing living environment, I believe that many people are being pushed forward. When I was walking, I was thinking what is my purpose today? I don’t know if everyone is confused, I sometimes feel a little overwhelmed. I feel that I am a piece of dust floating in this space, a forgotten piece. So I want to try to express the world I feel. As I looked at the vast sky and the traffic, I suddenly felt so small. So I put my feelings in a box. "I" is like that paper cranes, floating in the vast world. Maybe we can change the environment? What do you think if you're in this space？</p>
